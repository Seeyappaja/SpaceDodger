# Space Dodger
Project to reimplenent Gyruss an arcade game which had a tunner effect

## The plan:
Implement game logic - rotating player, input responses, scoring system, power ups(potentially)
Implement game objects - Meteor, Warp bubble, Stars

### Main gameplay loop:
Player tried to collect as many Warp bubbles as possible. If the player touches a meteor its game over. High score depends on how many warp bubbles player collected
